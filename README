Prim is a system for remote function and object access in Perl.  It's
based on xml packets sent over tcp sockets.  You need IO::Socket from
the standard distribution to use it.

Currently there is no make, make test, make install sequence since this
is not really ready for prime time.  Send in your input!

To use simply gunzip and untar.  Then run one of the servers:
trivialserver
trivialobjectserver
server
objectserver
After the server is up, run the corresponding client:
trivialclient
trivialobjectclient
client
objectclient

The trivial pair is documented in prim.pod.  The others are internally
documented (with POD inside the scripts).

This version has been successfully tested on Red Hat Linux 7.1 and on
HP-UX 11.0 using Perl 5.6.1 and 5.005_03 respectively.

The remote part of the scheme is a bit week at present, but it's mainly
a problem of finding the service, not of the services themselves.
If you're feeling adventerous and want to play with this, register primd 
with your inetd on port 5368 under the name prim.  Do this on one machine.
Start the server script on that machine.  On another machine run
the corresponding client giving the serving machines name or ip address
as the only argument.

Send me feedback: if you like it, if you hate it, if you want to fix it,
if you couldn't install it.  Send that feedback to
