primd server needs:
  a discovery scheme, primdchain has the beginning outline of one scheme
  to give its ip in the successful return packet
  an /etc/primd.d directory containing:
    conf, access, friends, log

Testing and Docs:
Automated Testing Help!
Keep up Documentation

Build the distribution, post to CPAN, and announce

Long Term:
Apply for module name space Prim::
Convert everything to use Prim:: namespace
Add call backs to get docs from each exposed method or devise a POD scheme.
Create an xml for diverting the user to a different server.
Ask about this:  Make sure taint checking is genuine.

Done:
  Put more thought into the XML so that all packets are wrapped the same way.
  Implement an inetd service which reads the /tmp entries upon client request.
  Add xml tags to allow for interchange of object reference keys.
  Give an example of a factory server.
  Create xml for requesting documentation, implement it.
  Expand the api for the constructor ...
    documentation is available without much trouble
  Correct documentation portions of client, server, objectclient, and
    objectserver to reflect documentation retrieval
  Change all push @responses ... join "", @responses to $response .= $_
  Prim discoveries read the tmp dir, then ignored result
  PrimClient and PrimObjectClient now use _send_and_receive_packet for all calls
  Document PrimObjectServer.pm, PrimObject.pm, and PrimObjectClient.pm
  Make a DTD for valid prim requests and responses.
  Have primd check /etc/primd.access for allowed or denied entries.
  Explain how to set up and use primd including /etc/primd.access
  The ACL ideas below became:
    Take a ACL file name in the constructor, make it like sample_server.acl
    Rejected (for now):
    ACLs:
    Have PrimServer store an ACL file in the /tmp/name.prim file.
    Apply ACL
    Expand the api for the constructor ...
      so that methods can control their visibility write these in ACL
  Change ACL check in send_documentation to check the function access
  Put new ACL check in primd, Prim.pm, and PrimObjectServer.pm
  Put signal handler in Prim.*Server.pm so it removes /tmp/name.prim
